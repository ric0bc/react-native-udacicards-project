# UdaciCards Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

This is a project for Udacity's react course.

## Install

npm start runs the app in dev mode.

```
npm install
npm start
```
Then you can tab "i" to open the iOS Simulator or "a" for Android.
